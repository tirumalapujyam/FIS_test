# Appliances Run

##### Application running steps

- To build application use MAVEN: **mvn clean install**
- The above command creates a binary jar file into *target* folder of the project.  
  Example: FIS_test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- we need to run the above jar to work/test the application and the command for that is  
  java -jar target/FIS_test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
